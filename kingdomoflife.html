    <p>The tree of life is used to explain the relationships between the different species on Earth. From microorganisms to trees to fungi and animals, life has evolved through time down countless pathways to provide us with the marvelous present-day collection of different species. Some species are closely related and, in other cases, we have to travel back billions of years to connect other species.<br><br> 
    The common belief in biology is that all living things evolved from a common ancestor more than 4 billion years ago. Now, many millions of different species call Earth home and, over the past 4 billion years, many more have come and gone.<br><br>
    Many scientists have devoted their lives to the giant task of working out the path life has taken to evolve from a single species into millions of different species. From one common ancestor, life has branched out to create a magnificent tree of life.<br><br></p>
    <strong><i>DOMAINS</i></strong>
    <p>Tree of life - domainsAll of life is currently separated into three different domains: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. The first two domains, Bacteria and Archaea, consist entirely of microscopic single-celled organisms. The third domain, Eukaryota, includes many microscopic organisms but also contains well-known groups such as animals, plants, and fungi.<br><br>
    Bacteria and archaea are called prokaryotes because their cells do not contain a nucleus. A nucleus is a membrane that surrounds the genetic material of a cell. The genetic material in the cells of bacteria and archaea are not enclosed in a membrane but sit tightly coiled in the center of the cell.</p>
